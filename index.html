             Hi! I'm Tanner. I consider myself a lot of things; language-lover, economics nerd, coffee enthusiast. But the most important one is a student. I graduated from Ball State University <a class='link' href="https://twitter.com/BallState/status/963956996830572544" target=blank>(the Harvard of Muncie)</a> in May of 2018 with a BA in International Business with a focus on Economics, I now work as a Trade Coordinator with FedEx Logistics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since graduating I have made a point to never stop learning. Whether from books, podcasts, or life experience, I want to keep moving forward! This website being a perfect example, I'm learning how to design my own website as a way of expanding my tools. Computers have always fascinated me, but I assumed I wasn't smart enough, didn't have the resources, or some other excuse that I wouldn't be able to do it. But here I am, trying and learning.
                <br>
               <br>
                As I continue to improve (my skill and this website) I plan to add more to document my thoughts and experiences so that I can share my worldview with others!
